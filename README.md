Semilla is a web presentation engine to manage software projects we developped
and use at fortylines.

Based on our [philosophy](https://fortylines.com/reps/whitepapers/doc/rationale.book) and [organization](https://fortylines.com/reps/whitepapers/doc/organization.book), instead of building a tower of babel made of various remote
resources (repositories, wikis, issue tracking systems, etc.) and dealing
with the associated IT nightmare, we keep code, documentation and todo items
in a single git repository.

Semilla is a straightforward presentation engine we use to navigate
that information through a web browser.
